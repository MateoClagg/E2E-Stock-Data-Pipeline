# 🚀 Quick Start - New Packaging System

## What Changed?
We upgraded your Python project with **automatic packaging and CI/CD**. Here's what you need to know:

## 🎯 **Immediate Benefits (No Setup Required)**
- ✅ **Fast PR builds**: 5-minute feedback on feature branches
- ✅ **Automatic versioning**: No more manual version bumps
- ✅ **Clean repository**: No more `.whl` files committed to git
- ✅ **Downloadable packages**: Get built wheels from GitHub Actions

## 🔥 **Test It Right Now**
```bash
# 1. Build locally to see it works
pip install build
python -m build
ls dist/  # You'll see: stock_pipeline-X.Y.Z-py3-none-any.whl

# 2. Test the package
pip install dist/*.whl
python -c "import bronze, silver; print('✅ Works!')"

# 3. Push and watch GitHub Actions
git add .
git commit -m "test: new packaging system"
git push origin feature/fmp-ingestion
# Check Actions tab - builds in ~5 minutes
```

## 📦 **Package Name Important Note**
- **Install**: `pip install stock-pipeline` (with hyphen)
- **Import**: `import stock_pipeline` and `import bronze, silver` (with underscore)

## 🎛️ **What Happens When**
- **Push to feature branch** → Fast 5-min build → Downloadable wheel (7 days)
- **Merge to main** → Comprehensive 10-min build → Full testing + security scan
- **Create git tag `v1.0.0`** → Full release → Published to private repository

## 🆘 **If Something's Wrong**
1. **Build fails?** Check GitHub Actions logs - likely a dependency issue
2. **Too complex?** We can simplify - just ask!
3. **Want AWS/Databricks?** See `docs/operations/` when ready

## 📁 **File Organization**
- **Root**: Only essential files (`README.md`, `pyproject.toml`, code)
- **`docs/`**: All documentation organized by topic
- **`databricks/`**: Databricks-specific files
- **`.github/`**: CI/CD automation

## 🎉 **Bottom Line**
Your code works the same, but now you get:
- Professional packaging
- Automatic builds
- Version management
- Clean git history

**Focus on your data pipeline - the packaging handles itself!**
