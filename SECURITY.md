## üîí Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, report security issues by:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (preferred):
   - Go to the Security tab of this repository
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the form with details

2. **Email** (alternative):
   - Send details to: mateo.clagg@gmail.com
   - Use subject line: "[SECURITY] stock-pipeline vulnerability report"
   - Include as much detail as possible

### What to Include

Please provide:

- **Description** of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Potential impact** and affected components
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
- **Your contact information** for follow-up

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

- **Never commit secrets** (API keys, passwords, certificates)
- **Use environment variables** for configuration
- **Validate all inputs** from external sources
- **Keep dependencies updated** and monitor for vulnerabilities
- **Follow principle of least privilege** in IAM policies

### For Users

- **Pin exact package versions** in production
- **Review SBOM files** attached to releases
- **Use secure credential management** (IAM roles, not access keys)
- **Monitor security advisories** for dependencies
- **Regularly update** to latest secure versions

## üîç Security Measures in Place

### Supply Chain Security

- **SBOM Generation**: Every release includes Software Bill of Materials
- **Dependency Scanning**: `pip-audit` runs on all builds
- **Signed Releases**: GitHub releases are cryptographically signed
- **Reproducible Builds**: Builds are deterministic and verifiable

### CI/CD Security

- **OIDC Authentication**: No long-term AWS credentials in CI
- **Minimal Permissions**: Workflows use least-privilege principle
- **Branch Protection**: Required reviews and status checks
- **Signed Commits**: Recommended for all contributions

### Infrastructure Security

- **CodeArtifact**: Private package repository with access control
- **IAM Policies**: Fine-grained permissions for AWS resources
- **Encryption**: All data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Audit Logging**: All access logged via CloudTrail
