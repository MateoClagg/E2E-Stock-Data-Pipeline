## 📊 **Workflow Breakdown**

### 1. **PR Build Workflow** (`pr-build.yml`)

**Triggers:** `pull_request` → `main`, `push` → `feature/*`

**Optimizations:**
```yaml
timeout-minutes: 5          # Hard 5-minute limit
fetch-depth: 1             # Shallow clone
python-version: ["3.11"]   # Single version only
build: wheel only          # Skip sdist for speed
tests: unit only          # Skip integration tests
```

**Steps (< 5 minutes):**
1. **Setup** (45s): Checkout + Python + cache restore
2. **Install** (60s): Minimal dependencies only  
3. **Lint** (15s): Critical errors only (non-blocking)
4. **Build** (30s): Wheel only + twine check
5. **Smoke Test** (20s): Import validation
6. **Unit Tests** (90s): Fast tests with timeout (non-blocking)
7. **Artifact** (10s): Upload PR package

**Developer Benefits:**
- ✅ **Fast feedback**: Know if changes break builds in < 5 minutes
- ✅ **Non-blocking**: Lint/test failures don't block PR creation
- ✅ **Focused**: Only critical checks for code review
- ✅ **Cached**: Aggressive caching for repeat builds

---

### 2. **Main Build Workflow** (`main-build.yml`)

**Triggers:** `push` → `main`

**Comprehensive Testing:**
```yaml
timeout-minutes: 10        # Full testing allowance
python-version: ["3.10", "3.11"]  # Full matrix
build: wheel + sdist       # Complete packages
tests: full suite         # All tests including coverage
```

**Parallel Jobs:**
- **Main Build**: Comprehensive testing + SBOM + security audit
- **PySpark Test**: Isolated Spark compatibility validation

**Steps (< 10 minutes):**
1. **Setup** (60s): Full checkout + multi-Python matrix
2. **Build** (45s): Both wheel and sdist + validation
3. **SBOM** (30s): Generate supply chain bill of materials
4. **Security** (45s): pip-audit vulnerability scan
5. **Test** (180s): Full test suite with coverage
6. **PySpark** (300s): Parallel Spark session testing
7. **Artifacts** (20s): Upload with 14-day retention

---

### 3. **Release Workflow** (`release.yml`)

**Triggers:** `push` → tags `v*`

**Release Guardrails:**
```yaml
🔒 CRITICAL GUARDRAILS:
✅ Tag ↔ version exact match
✅ Clean working tree (no uncommitted changes)  
✅ No dev/dirty version suffixes
✅ Package integrity validation
```

**Steps:**
1. **Guardrails** (30s): All safety checks MUST pass
2. **Build** (45s): Release packages (wheel + sdist)
3. **Security** (60s): SBOM + audit for release
4. **Publish** (120s): CodeArtifact + S3 + GitHub
5. **Notify** (10s): Rich Slack notifications

---

## ⚡ **Performance Optimizations**

### **Caching Strategy**
```yaml
# Separate cache keys for different workflows
pr-build:     "${{ runner.os }}-pip-fast-${{ hashFiles(...) }}"
main-build:   "${{ runner.os }}-pip-main-py${{ matrix.python-version }}-${{ hashFiles(...) }}"
release:      "${{ runner.os }}-pip-release-${{ hashFiles(...) }}"
pyspark:      "${{ runner.os }}-pyspark-cache"
```

### **Parallelization**
- **PR builds**: Single Python version (3.11) for speed
- **Main builds**: Matrix strategy with parallel PySpark job
- **Dependency installation**: Minimal deps for PR, full deps for main
- **Test execution**: Fast unit tests for PR, comprehensive for main

### **Resource Management**
```yaml
# Concurrency controls
pr-build:     cancel-in-progress: true   # Cancel old PR builds
main-build:   cancel-in-progress: false  # Never cancel main builds  
release:      cancel-in-progress: false  # Never cancel releases
```

### **Timeout Enforcement**
- **PR builds**: Hard 5-minute timeout prevents runaway builds
- **Main builds**: 10-minute timeout allows comprehensive testing
- **Individual steps**: Specific timeouts prevent hanging (e.g., pytest timeout 60s)
